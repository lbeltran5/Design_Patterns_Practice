Java Observer Design Pattern

This java design pattern comes under behavioural design patterns. This observer design pattern states that
define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents
are notified and updated automatically

The Observer design pattern works with 3 classes which are Subject, Observer and Client. Subjects consists of list of observers
and methods to attach and detach observers to a client object. It also contains a method to notify all the observers
of any change

MVC frameworks are the good example of observer design pattern.In MVC framework Model represents the Subject and Views refers to observers
which can be registered to get notified of any change to the model.
