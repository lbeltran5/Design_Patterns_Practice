Java Factory Design Pattern

In this design pattern we can create an object from a factory class without
exposing the creation of logic to the client. Objects will be created by an interface
or abstract class. The type of the object will be one of the subclasses
and it will depend upon the input which we pass to the factory.

The Main advantage of factory design pattern is to provide the loose-coupling

In this package is an example of different colors like Red, Blue, Pink and Yellow.
The Color Interface and sub classes will implement the Color interface. Then the ColorFactory
will get the different color types of objects and will pass the color type to the ColorFactory
to get that type of object.
